#in this segement, I am suppose to output numbers 1 - 9
#Fix the problem
#for i within range(1,9):
  #print(i)
 
#The problem with this code was that a)the comment wants us to output the numbers 1 - 9 but the above code will only output 1 - 8 because the the second digit needs to be +1 of what you want the number to be 
# so if you want an output of 1 - 11, then the range would include (1,12)
#in python, for loops correspond with the statement "in"

#with that, the solution for outputing the numbers 1 - 9 is below
for i in range(1, 10):
    print(i)
